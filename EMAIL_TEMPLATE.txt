Subject: 🚀 Chromium RAG Available - Search Chromium Commits in Copilot!

Hi Team,

I've set up a Chromium RAG server that lets you search through 244,403 Chromium commits directly in GitHub Copilot! 

🎯 What You Can Do:
- Ask questions about Chromium architecture in natural language
- Search for specific commits, features, or changes
- Get instant answers about V8, Blink, rendering, etc.
- All from within GitHub Copilot Chat!

⚡ Quick Setup (5 minutes):

1. Install Python package:
   pip install websockets

2. Download client file:
   I'll share chromium-rag-client.py with you
   Save it to: C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\

3. Add to VS Code settings.json (Ctrl+, then click {} icon):
   {
     "github.copilot.chat.mcp.servers": {
       "chromium-rag": {
         "command": "python",
         "args": [
           "C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\chromium-rag-client.py",
           "--server", "ws://10.172.20.59:8080",
           "--api-key", "JIn7DPXGnAckD_VESLuorrT3ehHEMiNrzg17G0GCZHk"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   
   (Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your Windows username!)

4. Restart VS Code

5. Try it out:
